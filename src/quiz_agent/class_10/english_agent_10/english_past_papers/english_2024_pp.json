In many parts of Africa, farmers cannot rear cattle on account of a kind of fly whose sting kills the cattle and causes sleeping sickness among human beings. In the absence of cattle, the farmer has to plough the fields with his hands, carry load to market and walk long distances. He may, however, keep a goat for milk, and poultry for eggs.",
