Rice is now one of the most important crops at the global level, as it is used as a staple food in most countries of the world and will continue to be so for the future. In the coming 30 years, the world will require 70% more rice than that it requires today. Pakistan is the world's 4th largest producer of rice. Each year, it produces an average of 6 million tons and together with the rest of the South Asia, the country supplies 30% of the world's rice. Rice is Pakistan's third largest crop in terms of area sown, after wheat and cotton. About 11 percent of Pakistan's total agriculture area is rice during the summer or \"Kharif\" season.",
