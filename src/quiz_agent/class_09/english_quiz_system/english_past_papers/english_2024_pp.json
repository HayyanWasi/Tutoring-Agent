Many parents believe that the educational process can be more effective if the classes are divided according to the gender of the students. Although same gender schools are considered too conservative and strict in today's time. Nevertheless, there are still supporters of this manner of education. Some parents are not in favour of co-educational system as they feel that the presence of opposite gender distracts the attention of students and prevents them from concentrating on studies. On the other hand, supporters of co-education feel that as boys and girls are different, it is a valuable experience for both genders to communicate with each other. Moreover, the earlier boys and girls begin to communicate, the sooner they acquire social skills, which are crucial to communicating freely in the world.
