## ✏️ Example Format

**Example 2.** If y = cos⁻¹((x² - 1)/(x² + 1)), find dy/dx.

**Solution:** Given that:

y = cos⁻¹((x² - 1)/(x² + 1))

Differentiating w.r.t 'x':

⇒ **Step 1:** Apply the chain rule for inverse cosine
Formula: d/dx(cos⁻¹u) = -1/√(1 - u²) · du/dx

⇒ dy/dx = -1/√(1 - ((x² - 1)/(x² + 1))²) · d/dx((x² - 1)/(x² + 1))

⇒ **Step 2:** Simplify the denominator
⇒ 1 - ((x² - 1)/(x² + 1))² = 1 - (x² - 1)²/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = ((x² + 1)² - (x² - 1)²)/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = ((x⁴ + 2x² + 1) - (x⁴ - 2x² + 1))/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = 4x²/(x² + 1)²

⇒ **Step 3:** Differentiate the rational function using quotient rule
⇒ d/dx((x² - 1)/(x² + 1)) = ((x² + 1)(2x) - (x² - 1)(2x))/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = (2x³ + 2x - 2x³ + 2x)/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = 4x/(x² + 1)²

⇒ **Step 4:** Combine results
⇒ dy/dx = -1/√(4x²/(x² + 1)²) · 4x/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = -1/(2x/(x² + 1)) · 4x/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = -(x² + 1)/(2x) · 4x/(x² + 1)²
⇒ = -4x(x² + 1)/(2x(x² + 1)²)
⇒ = -2/(x² + 1)

⇒ **dy/dx = -2/(x² + 1)** provided x ≠ 0

**Note:** This problem demonstrates the chain rule combined with careful algebraic simplification of composite functions involving inverse trigonometric functions.
